These all tries in one projects to check which is the best algorithm comparing on basis of r2_score , and when I deploy all these algos one by on at last I get best r2score of RandomForestRegressor algorithm :- 




# Projects 2 :- Project - Customer Segmentation 

Collection of My projects , in python , machine learning, deep learning and NLP
Customer Segmentation Project - Identify, Who are your Loyal Customers !
So what is Customer segmentation ?
It is one methodology using which we can divide our customers base into group of individuals who are similar in either gender, 
spending behavior, frequency to visit, age or any other demographies.

To segment customers  Calculate :
    1. RFM score for each customer
    2. Create clusters using K-means

What is RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis? 
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, 
frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers 
and perform targeted marketing campaigns.


Project 3 : - Spam mail detection

Problem :

Social communication has evolved, with e-mail still being one of the most common communication means, used for both formal and informal ways. With the increased usage of emails, variety of spam content also increase. Spam emails are inappropriate and unwanted messages usually sent to breach security. These spam emails include phishing URLs, advertisements, commercial segments, and a large number of indiscriminate recipients. Thus, such content is always a hazard for the user, and many studies have taken place to detect such spam content. However, there is a dire need to detect spam emails, which have content written in english language. The proposed project utilizes the existing machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression. According to my findings, the Logistic Regression model performs with a highest score of 96.40% accuracy.
